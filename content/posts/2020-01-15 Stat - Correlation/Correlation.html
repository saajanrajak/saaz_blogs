<div id="what-is-correaltion" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Correaltion?</h2>
<p>A Correlation of two variables indicates that as one variable change in value, how the the other variable will change. For example in <code>mtcars</code> data weight and Miles per gallon (mpg) highly are correlated, as <strong>Weight of a car increases, its distance traveled per gallon decreases</strong></p>
<p>Scatterplots is a great way to quickly check relationship between two continuous variable.</p>

<div id="different-types-of-correlation" class="section level2">
<h2>Different Types Of Correlation</h2>
<p>Usually in statistics we measure four types of Correlation</p>
<ul>
<li>Pearson Correlation</li>
<li>Kendall Rank Correlation</li>
<li>Spearman Correlation</li>
<li>Point-Biserial Correlation</li>
</ul>
<p>But for this blog, we will start with most common,The Pearson Correlation.</p>
</div>
<div id="pearson-correaltion-assesment" class="section level2">
<h2>Pearson Correaltion Assesment</h2>
<p>Pearson Correlation is a quantitative assessment that measures the strength and direction.
By visualizing the above graph, we can say that as the cars weight increase, miles traveled per gallon decreases. But its not a perfect relationship.</p>
<p>Pearson correlation coefficients generally represented by rho <span class="math inline">\((\rho)\)</span> . This coefficients is a single number which measures both strength and direction of linear relationship for two variables. Pearson correlation coefficients values ranges between -1 to +1.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> The greater the <strong>absolute value</strong> greater the <strong>strength</strong>
<ul>
<li>Extreme values +1 and -1 indicate a perfect linear relationship between two variables. A change in one variable is accompanied by a perfectly constant change in another.</li>
<li>A coefficients of <strong>0</strong> represents no linear relationship</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Direction:</strong> Coefficients sign represents the direction of relationship.
<ul>
<li>Positive coefficients indicate when the value of one variable increases, other variable value also increases and vice versa. In graph, it has <strong>upward slope</strong>.
+Negative Coefficients indicate when the value of one variable increases, other variable value decreases and vice versa. In graph, it has <strong>downward slop</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="graphical-assessment" class="section level2">
<h2>Graphical Assessment</h2>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-01-15 Stat - Correlation/Correlation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Pearson Correlation measure only the linear relationship. If however your data contain curvilinear relationship, it will not detect it as shown bottom right figure. However there is relationship between the variables but not the linear one.</p>
</div>
<div id="mathematical-calculation" class="section level2">
<h2>Mathematical Calculation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>heights = h1,h2,h3, …., <span class="math inline">\(h_n\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>weights = w1,w2,w3, ….., <span class="math inline">\(w_n\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>linear coefficient <code>$ r =\frac{cov(heights,weights)}{std(heights)*std(weights)} $</code></p>
<ul>
<li>cov: Covariance: Variance is the dispersion of a variable around the mean.</li>
<li>std: Standard Deviation: sqr root of variance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="r-calcualtion-and-represntation" class="section level2">
<h2>R Calcualtion and Represntation</h2>
<p>Here we will be using mtcars data (available in base r).The Correlation between two variables using <span class="math inline">\(cor()\)</span> function. By default it will calculate <em>pearson coefficient correlation</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Correlation between Weight and distance traveled per gallon in mtcars dataset
cor(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -0.8676594</code></pre>
<p>If you want to compute the <em>Spearman correlation</em>, add the argument <span class="math inline">\(method = &quot;spearman&quot;\)</span> to the cor() function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Spearman correlation
cor(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -0.886422</code></pre>
<p>We can also plot correlation matrix, but after removing categorical variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(corrplot)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## corrplot 0.90 loaded</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># removing categorical variable
dat &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%
  select(-vs, -am)

corrplot(cor(dat),
  method = &quot;circle&quot;,
  type = &quot;upper&quot; # show only upper side
)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="correlation-vs-causation" class="section level2">
<h2>Correlation v/s Causation</h2>
<p><strong>Correlation doesn’t imply Causation!</strong></p>
<p>Correlation between two variables indicates the the change in one variable associated with another variable. However it doesn’t imply that change in one variable <strong>actually causes</strong> the change in another variable.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is clear there is causal relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the the wattage of bulbs increase the brightness of the bulb.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classic Example</strong></p>
<p><img src="\images\cc_02.png" /></p>
<p>Ice cream sales and Shark attack are positively correlated, but clearly selling ice cream not causes the shark attack or vice versa. Instead a third variable outdoor temperature causes changes in other two variables. Higher temperature increases more sales of ice creams and more swimmer in the sea, which leads to more shark attacks.</p>
</div>
<div id="fun-facts" class="section level2">
<h2>Fun facts:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pearson Correlation</strong>: Evaluates linear relationship between two continuous variable.</li>
<li><strong>Spearman Correlation</strong>: Evaluates monotonic relationship based on the rank variable for each variable rather than the data.</li>
</ul>
