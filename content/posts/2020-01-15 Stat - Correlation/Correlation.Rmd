# **Objective**
The Objective of this blog is understand the basic concepts of Correlation. We are going to learn 

 * **_What is correlation?_**
 * **_Different Types Of Correlation_**
 * **_Pearson Correlation Assessment_**
 * **_Graphical Assessment_**
 * **_Mathematical Calculation_**
 * **_R Calculation_**
 * **_Correlation V/s Causation_**


## What is Correaltion?

A Correlation of two variables indicates that as one variable change in value, how the the other variable will change. For example Height and Weight are correlated, as height increases weight also tends to increase.

Scaterrplot is a great way to quickly check relationship between two continuous variable.

```{r include=FALSE}
#Load Library
require("tidyverse")

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Load the data
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/quest/Downloads/HeightWeight.csv")

df <- df %>% rename("height_m" = 'Height.M',weight_kg = "Weight.kg")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width= 6, fig.height=3}

ggplot(df,aes(height_m, weight_kg))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Height (Meter)", y = "Weight (Kg)",
       title = "Correlation Between Height and weight")+
  theme_minimal()

```

## Different Types Of Correlation

Usually in statistics we measure four types of Correlation

  * Pearson Correlation
  * Kendall Rank Correlation 
  * Spearman Correlation
  * Point-Biserial Correlation
  
 But for this blog, we will start with most common,The Pearson Correlation.

## Pearson Corealtion Assesment

Pearson Correlation is a quantitative assessment that measures the strength and direction.
By visualizing the above graph-1,we can say that as the person height increase the weight of person increases. But its not a perfect relationship. we can also find there are some sort people who have weight higher than the taller person. however as height increases weight increases.

Pearson correlation coefficients generally represented by rho $(\rho)$ . This coefficients is a single number which measures both strength and direction of linear relationship for two variables. Pearson correlation coefficients values ranges between -1 to +1. 

 * **Strength:** The greater the **absolute value** greater the **strength**
   + Extreme values +1 and -1 indicate a perfect linear relationship between two variables. A change in one variable is accompanied by a perfectly constant change in another.
   + A coefficients of **0** represents no linear relationship
   
   
 * **Direction:** Coefficients sign represents the direction of relationship.
   + Positive coefficients indicate when the value of one variable increases, other variable value also increases and vice versa. In graph, it has **upward slope**.
   +Negative Coefficients indicate when the value of one variable increases, other variable value decreases and vice versa. In graph, it has **downward slop**.
   
## Graphical Assessment

```{r echo=FALSE}
# +1 Slope
df_one <- data.frame(x = c(1:10),
                     y = c(seq(2,20,2)))

df_minus_one <- data.frame(x = c(1:10),
                     y = c(seq(20,2,-2)))

df_point_eight <- data.frame(x = c(1:7),
                             y = c(7,7.7,8,9,11,9,10))
df_parabola <- data.frame(x = c(seq(-2,4,1)),
                          y = c(5,0,-3,-4, -3, 0,5))

#df_circle <- data.frame()

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width= 8, fig.height=6 }

library(cowplot)
# graph
cor_1 <- ggplot(df_one, aes(x,y))+
   geom_point()

cor_m_1 <- ggplot(df_minus_one, aes(x,y))+
   geom_point()

cor_point_8 <- ggplot(df_point_eight, aes(x,y))+
  geom_point()

cor_parabola <- ggplot(df_parabola, aes(x,y))+
  geom_point()

plot_grid(cor_1, cor_m_1,
          cor_point_8 , cor_parabola, labels =c("cor = 1", "cor = -1", cor = 0.8, "No linear relation"), ncol = 2, nrow = 2)

```

Pearson Correlation measure only the linear relationship. If however your data contain curvilinear relationship, it will not detect it as shown bottom right figure.

Example: 

However there is relationship between the variables but not the linear one.



## Mathematical Calculation

* heights = h1,h2,h3, ...., $h_n$
* weights = w1,w2,w3, ....., $w_n$

- linear coefficient ` $ r =\frac{cov(heights,weights)}{std(heights)*std(weights)} $`



  - cov: Covariance: Variance is the dispersion of a variable around the mean.
  - std: Standard Deviation: sqr root of variance

## R Calcualtion and Represntation

Here we will be using mtcars data (available in base r).The Correlation between two variables using $cor()$ function. By default it will calculate *pearson coefficient correlation*.  

```{r}
# correlation between cylinder and displacement of different cars
cor(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$disp)

```


If you want to compute the *Spearman correlation*, add the argument $method = "spearman"$ to the cor() function:
```{r}
# spearman correlation
cor(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,method = "spearman") 
```



We can also plot correlation matrix, but after removing categorical variable.

```{r, fig.height= 3, fig.width=5}
library(corrplot)

# removing categorical variable
dat <- mtcars %>%
  select(-vs, -am)

corrplot(cor(dat),
  method = "circle",
  type = "upper" # show only upper side
)
```



## Correlation v/s Causation

Correlation doesn't imply Causation

Correlation between two variables indicates the the change in one variable associated with another variable. However it doesn't imply that change in one variable **actually causes** the change in another variable.

Sometimes it is clear there is causal relationship. 

* For the height and weight data, adding more vertical structure to body causes the total mass increase. 
* Increase the the wattage of bulbs increase the brightness of the bulb.

Ice cream sales and Shark attack are positively correlated, but clearly selling ice cream not causes the shark attack or vice versa. Instead a third variable outdoor temperature causes changes in other two variables. Higher temperature increases more sales of ice creams and more swimmer in the sea, which leads to more shark attacks.



## Fun facts: 
* **Pearson Correlation**: Evaluates linear relationship between two continuous variable.
* **Spearman Correlation**: Evaluates monotonic relationship based on the rank variable for each variable rather than the  data.



Happy Learning :)
