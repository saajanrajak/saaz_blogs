This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```r

<p>Add a new chunk by clicking the <em>Insert Chunk</em> button on the toolbar or by pressing <em>Ctrl+Alt+I</em>.</p>
<p>When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the <em>Preview</em> button or press <em>Ctrl+Shift+K</em> to preview the HTML file).</p>
<p>The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike <em>Knit</em>, <em>Preview</em> does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.</p>
