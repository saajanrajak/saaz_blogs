# **Introduction**

The Objective of this blog is to understand basic concepts of Logistic Regression. We are going to learn today

- **What is Logistic Regression?**
- **Logistic Regression Programming in R**
- **Interpreting Logistic Regression Results**

# **What is Logistic Regression**

Logistic Regression is predictive modeling technique for **discrete/categorical outcome** from single/set of input variables. The most common logistic regression outcomes are **Yes/No**, **TRUE/False**, **1/0**, **Small/Medium/Large**.
 
- **Binary Logistic Regression**: Logistic Regression where output variable is 2 category. Like **This/That**, **Yes/No**, **A/B**
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Logistic Regression where output variable is more than 2 category. Example **A/B/C**, **Small/Medium/Large**. 


Logistic Regression is one of the most commonly used predictive technique to predict binary classification problem.

Real world Examples.

- E-commerce company want to know which customer would like to be **Retained/Churn** after coming to their site, from customer behavior data. 
- Similarly, Credit Company wants to predict which customer is going to be **Defaulter/Not Defaulter** on credit card by characteristics like Customer Annual Income, Monthly credit card payment,  number of defaults etc.



## **Logistic v/s Linear Regression**
 
The main difference between Logistic and Linear regression is type of output variable. Linear Regression output variable is **Continuous** while Logistic Regression output variable is **Discrete/Categorical**.

Examples

- Linear Regression: How many products a customer can buy in a month period.
- Logistic Regression: Would this customer will buy again after a month from his first order date.
