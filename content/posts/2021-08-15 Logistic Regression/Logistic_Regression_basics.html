<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p>The Objective of this blog is to understand basic concepts of Logistic Regression. We are going to learn today</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is Logistic Regression?</strong></li>

<h1><strong>What is Logistic Regression</strong></h1>
<p>Logistic Regression is predictive modeling technique for <strong>discrete/categorical outcome</strong> from single/set of input variables. The most common logistic regression outcomes are <strong>Yes/No</strong>, <strong>TRUE/False</strong>, <strong>1/0</strong>, <strong>Small/Medium/Large</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary Logistic Regression</strong>: Logistic Regression where output variable is 2 category. Like <strong>This/That</strong>, <strong>Yes/No</strong>, <strong>A/B</strong></li>
<li><strong>Multinomial Logistic Regression</strong>: Logistic Regression where output variable is more than 2 category. Example <strong>A/B/C</strong>, <strong>Small/Medium/Large</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logistic Regression is one of the most commonly used predictive technique to predict binary classification problem.</p>
<p>Real world Examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>E-commerce company want to know which customer would like to be <strong>Retained/Churn</strong> after coming to their site, from customer behavior data.</li>
<li>Similarly, Credit Company wants to predict which customer is going to be <strong>Defaulter/Not Defaulter</strong> on credit card by characteristics like Customer Annual Income, Monthly credit card payment, number of defaults etc.</li>
</ul>
<div id="logistic-vs-linear-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Logistic v/s Linear Regression</strong></h2>
<p>The main difference between Logistic and Linear regression is type of output variable. Linear Regression output variable is <strong>Continuous</strong> while Logistic Regression output variable is <strong>Discrete/Categorical</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear Regression: How many products a customer can buy in a month period.</li>
<li>Logistic Regression: Would this customer will buy again after a month from his first order date.</li>
</ul>
